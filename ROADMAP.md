# Rastok roadmap

This roadmap is organized by evidence gates, not by a speculative
sequence of product releases.

## Done — M0 mechanical proof (exited 2026-08-04)

M0 answered one question: can the central technical loop work end to
end? It can — the evidence is recorded in
[`docs/architecture/m0-exit-report.md`](docs/architecture/m0-exit-report.md).

- Parse and check the smallest useful `.rkg` subset.
- Lower it to an executable plan.
- Execute it in a one-worker in-memory VM.
- Run one scenario with a mock, virtual time, and a golden trace.
- Cross one real `Process` boundary.
- Produce a useful diff at the first divergence.
- Reproduce the result on two machines.

Out of scope: a complete connector catalogue, live Saga or Loop
managers, durable deployment, enterprise security, UI, registry, and
cluster operation.

## Done — M0.5 engine consolidation (closed 2026-08-06)

Consolidated what M0 proved before widening it
([`docs/architecture/m0.5-slice.md`](docs/architecture/m0.5-slice.md)):

- The delivery reference specified and the call identity derived
  from it — the multiport prerequisite, spec-first.
- The no_std-ready core (`rastok-core`) split from the std layer,
  with CI guarding the frontier; neutrality proven by the unchanged
  semantic hash.
- The executable plan carried as a versioned, verifiable package
  with typed refusals.
- The embedded spike run emulated against its written go/no-go —
  provisional GO, silicon confirmation pending hardware.
- The connector conformance harness over the `Partner` seam —
  the M0 subset of the ten contract cases made executable (error-set,
  journal, timeout, cancel, silence, and interleaved-correlation
  disciplines; the declarative cases as sheet checks), with every
  unproven gap explicit; `Process` re-expressed on it.
- The verified-authorship benchmark built and rehearsed dry — twenty
  referee-checked tasks, a frozen prompt card, the full
  generate → check → retry → simulate loop measured on recorded
  attempts; the paid model wave is deliberately deferred.

## Now — M1, the demonstrable integration slice

The question this slice answers: can a realistic asynchronous
integration seam — request, external partner, late callback — be
built, simulated, and shown end to end, before its real systems
exist? Scope, order, and evidence:
[`docs/architecture/m1-slice.md`](docs/architecture/m1-slice.md).
The repository opens publicly with this milestone (15 October 2026).

- Multiport execution, then the constructs that stand on it: the
  `per` partition surface (including bounded stop/drain/cancel of open
  invocations) and bounded joins.
- A JSON/JSONL codec chain across the boundaries.
- M1.3 resets the payload foundation: one Rastok-owned logical type and
  value algebra, complete effective types on every port, unions across
  JSON/Avro/Arrow projections, one expression consumer, and ordinary
  multi-output completions (for `Process`: decoded `out`, exact stderr on
  `err`, and one typed `exit` per invocation). This subsumes the original
  typed-error item: its codes become `ProcessExit` cases. Partition `stop`
  remains a distinct, later lifecycle boundary.
  B1's complete strict-profile type/value domain, B2's total validated
  port-type resolution, B3's Rastok-owned expression consumer/narrowing
  core, B4's one `name!` frontend surface, and B5's uniform resolved
  Connector port contracts are landed. B6 has added general tagged-value
  construction, one contextual union-wrapping door and ordinary `err`
  emission. B7 has replaced the success/failure seam with atomic ordered
  completions: `Process(job)` now publishes unit-framed `out*`, independently
  framed stderr on `err*`, and exactly one typed `exit`. B8 has published the
  categorical v7 type/value/expression registry and mandatory total resolved
  port table, removing the last Process/decimal transport bridges. B9 has
  closed M1.3: strict JSON Schema, Avro and Arrow projections either preserve
  the complete logical type or refuse by path and reason; `variant` requires
  explicit narrowing before structural inspection; the obsolete v6
  type/expression scaffolding is gone; and the cross-layer corpus, three
  no-std targets and emulated Cortex-M33 proof are green. The closing review
  also removed the last synthetic Operator fault channel: an optional
  `err: E` is explicit domain output, while engine faults abort and reach
  supervision.
- `File`, HTTP client and server boundaries under their contract
  sheets, each on the conformance harness.
- Governed retry: the `Loop` aspect, driven by an explicitly selected
  typed exit case rather than a privileged error channel.
- Per-flow cost counters, carried by the journal.
- A live view of the running graph, fed by the journal.
- A guided example gallery seeded by the benchmark's reference
  solutions, closed by the October demo flow.

## Later — incident lab and safe dogfood

- Turn one real internal failure into a redacted fixture and scenario.
- Run in a trusted, non-critical environment with a kill switch.
- Measure installation time, diagnosis time, cost per session, and
  maintenance effort.
- Test the same proof with selected design partners.

## Then — transferability

- A third party installs Rastok from the documentation.
- That party changes or writes a graph.
- A third-party incident becomes a replayable regression scenario.
- At least one partner uses the proof in its own technical evaluation.

Only evidence from these gates determines the next product scope.
